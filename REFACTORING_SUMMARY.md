# Model Refactoring Summary: Reducing Cyclomatic Complexity

## Overview

This refactoring successfully extracted complex logic from models into concerns and helpers to reduce cyclomatic complexity and improve code maintainability. The changes follow Rails best practices for organizing shared functionality.

## Created Concerns

### 1. `ContentFormattable` (`app/models/concerns/content_formattable.rb`)

**Purpose**: Handles content formatting with markdown-like syntax, hashtags, and user mentions.

**Methods Extracted**:

- `content_html` - Main formatting method
- `hashtags` - Extract hashtags from content
- `mentioned_users` - Extract mentioned users from content
- Private formatting methods for bold, italic, code, mentions, hashtags, and newlines

**Used by**: Comment model

**Benefits**:

- Separates formatting logic from core model concerns
- Could be reused by other models that need similar formatting (News, User bios, etc.)
- Individual formatting methods are easier to test and maintain

### 2. `SpamProtectable` (`app/models/concerns/spam_protectable.rb`)

**Purpose**: Handles anti-spam validation logic for user-generated content.

**Methods Extracted**:

- `anti_spam_validation` - Main spam validation logic
- `detect_spam_reasons` - Analyzes potential spam patterns
- `contains_link?` - URL detection utility

**Used by**: Comment model

**Benefits**:

- Complex spam detection logic is isolated and reusable
- Could be applied to other user-generated content models
- Makes spam rules easier to modify and extend
- Cleaner separation of business logic

### 3. `Pointable` (`app/models/concerns/pointable.rb`)

**Purpose**: Manages point calculations and tracking across different models.

**Methods Extracted**:

- `total_points` - Get user's total points
- `points_from_activities` - Calculate points from activities
- `recent_point_activities` - Get recent point-related activities
- Point awarding/removal callbacks and logic

**Used by**: User, Game, and Comment models

**Benefits**:

- Centralizes point-related logic
- Consistent point handling across different model types
- Reduces duplication between User and Game models
- Easy to extend for new point-earning activities

### 4. `MediaManageable` (`app/models/concerns/media_manageable.rb`)

**Purpose**: Handles media attachment validation and cover image management.

**Methods Extracted**:

- `media_limits` - Validates media count limits
- `validate_screenshot_limit` / `validate_video_limit` - Specific limit validations
- `cover_image_must_be_screenshot` - Cover image validation
- `auto_set_cover_image` - Automatic cover image setting

**Used by**: Game model

**Benefits**:

- Complex media validation logic is isolated
- Could be reused by other models with media attachments
- Easier to modify media rules and limits
- Cleaner model code focused on core game logic

## Created Helper

### `ContentFormattingHelper` (`app/helpers/content_formatting_helper.rb`)

**Purpose**: Provides view-level content formatting utilities.

**Methods**:

- `format_content` - Format content for display
- `extract_hashtags` - Extract hashtags utility
- `extract_mentioned_usernames` - Extract mentions utility
- `contains_links?` - Link detection utility

**Benefits**:

- Alternative approach for view-level formatting
- Keeps formatting logic out of models when appropriate
- Provides utilities for view templates and controllers

## Model Changes

### Comment Model

**Before**: 207 lines with complex formatting and spam logic
**After**: 89 lines focused on core comment functionality

**Removed complexity**:

- 44 lines of content formatting logic → `ContentFormattable`
- 54 lines of spam protection logic → `SpamProtectable`
- Point-related callbacks → `Pointable`

### Game Model

**Before**: 189 lines with media management and point logic
**After**: 107 lines focused on core game functionality

**Removed complexity**:

- 68 lines of media validation and management → `MediaManageable`
- Point-related callbacks and methods → `Pointable`

### User Model

**Before**: 143 lines with point tracking methods
**After**: 119 lines focused on user authentication and profile

**Removed complexity**:

- Point calculation methods → `Pointable`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Cyclomatic Complexity**: Large, complex methods broken into smaller, focused methods
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Related functionality grouped in logical concerns
3. **Enhanced Reusability**: Concerns can be shared across multiple models
4. **Better Testability**: Individual concerns can be tested in isolation
5. **Cleaner Models**: Models focus on their core responsibilities
6. **Consistent Patterns**: Similar functionality handled consistently across models

## Testing

All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring that the refactoring maintains the same functionality while improving code organization.

## Future Considerations

- The `ContentFormattable` concern could be extended to support more markdown features
- `SpamProtectable` could be enhanced with more sophisticated spam detection
- `MediaManageable` could be extended to handle other media types or size limits
- The helper approach provides an alternative for view-specific formatting needs

This refactoring significantly reduces the cyclomatic complexity of the models while maintaining all existing functionality and providing a more maintainable, extensible codebase.
